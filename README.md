I have developed an E-commerce business application and exposed several APIs for its functionality. The application is designed to efficiently manage and provide access to various aspects of the business, ensuring a seamless user experience. Below is a summary of the implemented APIs:

    1) Customer Wishlist API: Returns the wishlist of a specified customer.
    2) Daily Sales API: Provides the total sales amount for the current day.
    3) Max Sales Day API: Returns the day with the highest sales within a specified date range.
    4) Top Selling Items API (All-Time): Lists the top 5 selling items of all time, based on total sales amount.
    5) Top Selling Items API (Last Month): Lists the top 5 selling items from the previous month, based on the number of sales.

#Framework Requirements

    An IntelliJ IDEA of my choice
    Spring Boot version '3.3.1'
    JDK 17
    Log4j2
    MySQL
    Entity Relationship Diagram from source
    Not use the docker

Furthermore, I have followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure high code quality and reliability, with comprehensive unit tests covering the service, repository, and controller layers.
